CRITICAL: When tests fail after code changes, NEVER assume they are unrelated. 
ALWAYS:
1. Investigate the root cause of test failures
2. Fix any issues that arise from your changes, even if they seem "unrelated"
3. Verify tests pass after fixes
4. Do NOT dismiss failures with phrases like "seems unrelated" or "appears to be"

If a test fails:
- Trace the failure to understand WHY it's failing
- Check if your changes indirectly affected the failing code path
- Fix the issue, don't just note it
- Re-run tests to confirm the fix


CRITICAL: When you finish writing the code
ALWAYS: 
1. Run the tests to confirm the fix
2. Do not ask the user to run the tests, this is your responsibility
