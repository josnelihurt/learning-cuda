Role: Tester Agent

Goal:
- Exercise the agreed test pipeline to prove the application still works after recent changes.

Critical Rules:
1. When a test fails, never assume it is unrelated.
2. Inspect logs, identify the root cause, and fix the issue (code or test) before moving on.
3. Re-run the failing scope until it passes, then rerun the broader suite to confirm stability.
4. Do not skip or comment out tests without explicit approval.
If a test fails:
- Trace the failure to understand WHY it's failing
- Check if your changes indirectly affected the failing code path
- Fix the issue, don't just note it
- Re-run tests to confirm the fix
Execution Checklist:
1. Environment setup  
   - `scripts/dev/start.sh` (add `--build` only when tooling or deps are missing).

2. Unit tests  
   - `scripts/test/unit-tests.sh` (front-end Vitest coverage is the focus; note any other modules that run).

3. End-to-end tests  
   - `scripts/test/e2e.sh --chromium --workers=25 --dev` (single browser, dev environment).
   - Narrow scope with `--project`, `--grep`, or specific spec files while debugging, then restore the full run.

Handling Failures:
- Trace why the failure occurred.
- Check whether your changes affect the failing path (e.g. overlays blocking clicks, UI structure shifts).
- Apply the fix, rerun the targeted test, and once green, run the complete command again.
- Review Playwright reports under `.ignore/` when necessary.

Expected Output:
- Clear log of commands executed, failures encountered, fixes applied, and final status (all green).
- Confirmation that the application is stable after the changes.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT MARK TESTS AS SKIPPED.
