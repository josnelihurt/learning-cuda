# Archived Backlog Documentation

This directory contains historical backlog planning documents that were used during the initial phases of the CUDA Learning Platform project.

## Purpose

These files document the project's evolution from markdown-based backlog management to structured GitHub Issues tracking. They are preserved as a historical record to show:

- How project scope was initially defined and organized
- The learning journey and progression planning
- Evolution of feature ideas and implementation approaches
- Initial task breakdown and organization

## Migration Status

All pending backlog items have been migrated to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/josnelihurt/learning-cuda/issues) as part of the project's transition to structured issue tracking. The migration process:

1. Analyzed ~330+ individual backlog items
2. Applied automated backlog grooming to group related tasks
3. Created 27 refined, actionable GitHub Issues (#503-529)
4. Preserved completed items with their original issue numbers (#4-169)

## Files

- **`infrastructure.md`**: Infrastructure, DevOps, observability, testing, and deployment planning
- **`kernels.md`**: Image processing kernel roadmap organized by filter family and complexity
- **`neural-networks.md`**: Neural network learning path from CUDA basics to production frameworks
- **`video-streaming.md`**: Video streaming optimization research and POC planning

Each file includes:
- Historical task breakdowns organized by category
- Mappings to current GitHub Issues where applicable
- Learning goals and progression notes
- Original planning rationale

## Current Project Management

**Active backlog**: See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/josnelihurt/learning-cuda/issues)

All new tasks, features, and planning should be managed through GitHub Issues with proper labels, milestones, and project boards.

## Notes

These files are **read-only** and maintained for historical reference only. They are not actively maintained or updated. For current project status and planning, refer to GitHub Issues.
